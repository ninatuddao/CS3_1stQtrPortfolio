# List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with twoto five sentences.

1. Arithmetic Operators - These are simple mathematical symbols that we have already been studying since Grade 8. I understand how each operator works and how they can be applied to variables and values.
2. HTML - This is the standard language used to create the structure of webpages. Majority of this topic was easy to understand and we had multiple activities which allowed us to get used to using HTML.
3. JavaScript Syntax - This refers to the rules that determine how JavaScript code is written and understood by the computer. I am confident in using variables and operators such as ending statements with semicolons.
4. JavaScript Operations - These involve using different operators to manipulate data, such as arithmetic, comparison, and logical operations. I understand how each operator works and how I can use them in different scenarios.
5. JavaScript Statements - These are the instructions that the browser executes step by step. I know how to use conditional statements like if else because it is similar to C++ which we studied in Grade 8.

# List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why.  The why should be per topic listed.  

1. CSS - Generally, I understand the basics of CSS like styling text and color. Although, I still need practice on how to do more advanced things like margins and flexbox. Whenever doing CSS, I still need guidance to remember how to do specific actions.
2. Loop Control Structures (while, do..while, for..in) - Although I understand how loops work, I need more practice applying them in real situations. I still need to memorize when to use which loop when writing a code.
3. Loop Control Structures (break, continue, Nested Loop) - I understand the purpose of break and continue, but I still need more practice applying them correctly. Same with the last topic, I still need to memorize when and how I can use these control structures in a code.
4. Declaring Functions - I already know the basics of declaring functions, but I need more practice in understanding parameters and return values. There are times when I forget how to fix my functions when they are not working how I want them to.
5. Event Handlers - I still need help understanding how Event Handlers work. I also need more practice on how to use them in a code.

# Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items.
1. CSS - Since I enjoy designing webpages, I will try practicing how to use CSS by doing small projects for myself. I will also watch video tutorials on anything I still don't understand that well.
2. Loop Control Structures - I will review the use of each type of loop and practice using them in different codes. I will also do my research on anything I need help understanding.
3. Declaring Functions - I will practice writing functions with parameters and return values, and use them in small programs. I will also review examples of built-in JavaScript functions to understand structure.
4. Event Handlers - I will do research on how Event handlers work so I can understand how to use them. To add to that, I will also practice using Event handlers by writing my own code.

# In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why?

Effective:
1. Graded exercises - The graded exercises allowed me to practice all of the topics we learned in the 1st Quarter. By doing them, it helps me understand the topic more and how I can use them in code.
2. Long Tests - These allow me to review all of the topics that will be covered in the exam. Like the graded exercises, they help me know how to use the different topics when writing code.

Not effective:
1. Long lectures - I find it difficult to understand the lesson in class. Usually I still have to do my own research to fully understand the topic.
2. Diagnostic Exams - They didn't really help me learn anything new because it was already concepts we learned in the past. Though it did help me review past lessons, I wasn't able to understand anything new.
